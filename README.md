# DiffuER

This repo contains the code for `DiffuER: Auxiliary Regularized Diffusion Language Model
for Semantic Preserving Text Generation`

## Overview

we propose DiffuER (Diffusion with Embedding and Reconstruction loss). By utilizing word embeddings from a pre-trained masked language model as auxiliary regularization and leveraging a simple encoder-decoder module to reconstruct the original text from the generated sequence, our proposed method enhances the model‚Äôs capability of capturing and preserving semantics.

On two diffusion language models and three text generation tasks, our proposed DiffuER achieves a maximum reduction of 38.7 in perplexity and outperforms all diffusion-based baselines in other metrics.



## ‚öôÔ∏è Experiment Setup

**Virtual Env Configurateion**

To run the following command, a anaconda should be installed.

```shell
conda create -n diffuer python=3.10       # create an conda env named `diffuer`
conda activate diffuer                    # enter the conda env
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 # install torch
pip install -r requirments.txt            # install dependencies
```

Additionally, refer to `https://github.com/pltrdy/files2rouge` to install files2rouge in the current env.

## Training

To train a model
- run `bash scripts/run_qqp.sh` to train, inference and evaluate the QQP dataset.
- run `bash scripts/run_ts.sh` to train, inference and evaluate the text simplification dataset.
- run `bash scripts/iwslt.sh` to train, inference and evaluate the iwslt2014 dataset.

In the scripts, you can enable the pratrained embedding loss to set `USE_TEACHER=True` and enable the reconstruction loss to set `USE_AUX_AR_MODEL=True`
